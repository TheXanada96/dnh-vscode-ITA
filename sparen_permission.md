To Mr. Serajnik,

If you would like to use my function reference for your VS Code extension,
please feel free to do so. However, I may update the JSON files without prior
notice if a bug report comes in, and there is no guarantee of accuracy, since
most of the information was copied and adapted from a public wiki + Google
Translate. The structure of the JSON files should not change anytime in the
future, but if it does there will probably be no prior notice.

If you do use it though, it would be preferable to cite me in the credits and
also provide a link to my English function reference at
https://sparen.github.io/ph3tutorials/docs.html as well as the official
documentation at
http://www.geocities.co.jp/SiliconValley-Oakland/9951/pre/th_dnh_help_v3.html

This should ensure that if something *is* wrong, the source and official
reference can be found with ease.

Thank you,

Andrew Fan (Sparen of Iría)
